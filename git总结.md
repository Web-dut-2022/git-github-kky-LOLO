## 学习总结

### 1. Git

It's advanced for me. But I can still study some useful code on it. Github is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

#### 1.1 Repositories

A repository is where my project work happens--think of it as my project folder. It contains all of my project’s files and revision history. I can invite other to make my code better.

#### 1.2 Cloning

When a repository is created with GitHub, it’s stored remotely in the Cloud.Clone a repository to create a local copy on my computer and then use Git to sync the two.

#### 1.3 fork

A fork is another way to copy a repository, but is usually used when I want to contribute to someone else’s project.

#### 1.4 Branches

Branches is used on GitHub to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet.Once our new changes have been reviewed by a teammate, or I am satisfied with them, I can merge your changes into the default branch of your repository. 

#### 1.5 Pull requests

When working with branches, I can use a pull request to tell others about the changes I want to make and ask for their feedback. Once a pull request is opened, I can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add more changes if need be. 

### 2.Summary

I think I need more time to learn how to use it because of the English environment. But I have already known that the Git can give me great help.
